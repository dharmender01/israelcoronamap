To translate the hebrew data to a language:
	
	bash translate.sh <LANGUAGE>

Where LANGUAGE is the two-letter language code: en, ar, fr, etc.
This outputs the translated data to data-<LANGUAGE>.json, and maintains a cache at translation_cache_<LANGUAGE>.json


To update the translated data and the translation cache with a manual translation, use:

	python update.py <LANGUAGE> <PATH>

Where PATH points to a JSON file with the manual translation, structured in the following way:
[
	{id: 1, label: 'Example label'},
	{id: 2, label: 'Example label'},
	...
]

The list of languages which have been updated with manual translations is maintained at updated.json.
